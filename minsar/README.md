Code powering the InSAR software of the University of Miami Geodesy lab. To run this you need to have JPL's ISCE and a bunch of other sofware,  which are installed as explained in rsmas_insar. The code will be published together with a paper on our volcano monitoring system that pushes data products to insarmaps.miami.edu test_feb24
